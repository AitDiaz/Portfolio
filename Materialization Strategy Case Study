The following is an example of the definition and implementation of a materialization strategy. 
This example uses the Snowflake technology. Note that the names of the table types may vary from one technology to another, and although the analysis process is still useful, it is recommended that you read the documentation of the specific technology for your case.

For designing the Business Case, the technique will be implemented following the BABOK guide best practices. 
The business case, thus, will be divided into :
                       1.- Need Assesment
                       2.- Desired Outcomes
                       3.- Assess Alternatives
                       4.- Recommended solution



1.- NEED ASSESMENT
Our fictional company, ABC Inc., is in the private banking and wealth management business. As a growing organization, the complexity of their systems is increasing rapidly. As a result, they want to update their systems with a modern approach. 
They are currently in the process of migrating to Snowflake to store their semi-structured data and then create data marts for each of the operational units, using Trino as the query engine and the appropriate analytics tools at the end user level. 

For the migration, you are working on the requirements for the materialization strategy. This is a critical step because one of the benefits of using data lakes is that storage costs are low and by optimizing processing costs you can improve profitability. 
Currently, data is stored in tables and stored procedures are used to populate views in SQL that are then consumed by users' analytical tools. 


Now we can define the need as: based on operational requirements from user usage patterns, define the types of tables and views for migration. 


2.- DESIRED OUTCOME

Is required to provide the guidelines and rationale for the best implementation of the materialization strategy for the migration. 

3.- ASSESS ALTERNATIVES
To properly the alternatives, letÂ´s understand what are the tpes of tables and views in Snowflake:
      Tables:
           I.-  Permanent tables: these tables store data permanently and are fully durable. They are part of the database schema and are not automatically removed or modified.
           II.- Temporary tables: these tables exist only for the duration of a session. They are automatically dropped when the session ends, which means they are not persistent between different user sessions.
           III.-Transient tables: these tables are similar to permanent tables but without the same level of data recovery and durability. Data in transient tables is not protected by Snowflake's Fail-safe feature and can be used for temporary storage that is still intended to last beyond a single session.
     Views:
           I.- Non materialized: these are virtual tables that are defined by a query. The data is not physically stored; instead, the view dynamically retrieves data from the underlying tables when queried.
           II.-Materialized: these views store the result of the query physically. The data is precomputed and stored, which can improve query performance. Materialized views are refreshed periodically based on defined policies.

Use cases:
     Tables:
           I.-  Permanent tables:: Storing critical and long-term data such as customer records, transactional data, or historical logs.
                                   Suitable for data that needs to be retained and accessed over time with full durability and recovery options. 

           II.- Temporary tables: Storing intermediate results during complex queries or ETL processes.
                                  Performing data transformations or staging data temporarily without affecting permanent storage.

           III.-Transient tables: Storing intermediate or staging data that needs to persist beyond a session but does not require the full durability of permanent tables.
                                  Useful for temporary analytical or processing tasks where data is important but not critical. 
     
Views:
           I.- Non materialized: Simplifying complex queries by creating reusable query definitions.
                                 Presenting data in a specific format or aggregated form without storing it physically.
                                 Ideal for scenarios where the underlying data changes frequently and you want the latest data without additional storage costs.
           II.-Materialized: Optimizing performance for frequently queried data, especially when the underlying data does not change frequently.
                             Reducing the computational cost and latency of complex aggregations or joins by storing precomputed results.
                             Suitable for dashboards or reports where performance is critical, and the data is not constantly changing.

To understand how data is stored in a data lakehouse, we also need to understand the medallion architecture:
The medallion architecture is a layered approach to organizing data in a data lake to improve data quality, performance, and usability. It divides data processing into three main layers, or "medallions," each with a specific purpose.

                      1.- Bronze Data (Raw): This layer stores raw, unprocessed data directly ingested from various sources. It retains the original data format and is typically used for historical records.
                      2.- Silver (Cleansed): This layer cleanses, transforms, and integrates data. The focus is on improving data quality by removing errors, normalizing formats, and combining data from different sources.
                      3.- Gold (Curated): The Gold layer contains highly processed and aggregated data tailored for business analysis and reporting. This data is often summarized and optimized for performance.  


2.- RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:

Once we understood the tools at hand, and the context we can provide a recommendation for architecting the storage of our fictional company ABC Inc.

   * For the Bronze layer, we will primarily use permanent tables and non-materialized views to store historical data, enable the necessary read operations for the subsequent layer, and ensure a consistent view of the raw data without any transformations.
   * For the Silver layer, we will primarily use transient and permanent tables, along with non-materialized views, to store cleansed and integrated data and provide a streamlined view for further processing. This approach supports efficient transformation and integration while maintaining data quality and accessibility.
   * For the Gold layer, we will primarily use persistent tables and materialized views to store aggregated and business-ready data. This setup ensures optimized performance for end-user queries and reporting by providing pre-computed results and quick access to high-value insights.

    transaction_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id STRING,
    transaction_date DATE,
    transaction_amount NUMBER(10, 2),
    transaction_type STRING,
    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES ABCInc.clients(client_id)  -- Fixed reference
