Hereâ€™s how you can structure the Python job to extract data from a CSV file, perform some minor transformations, and save the output to another CSV file.

1. Python Job Code
This Python script uses pandas for data manipulation and will save the transformed data to a new CSV file.

import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Read data from the CSV file
input_file_path = "path/to/input_file.csv"  # Replace with your input file path
output_file_path = "path/to/transformed_file.csv"  # Path to save the transformed file

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(input_file_path)

# Step 2: Perform minor transformations
# Example transformation: trim whitespace from a specific column and fill nulls
df['trimmed_column'] = df['column_name'].str.strip()  # Replace 'column_name' with actual column
df['column_to_fill'] = df['column_to_fill'].fillna('Unknown')  # Handling nulls

# Step 3: Save the transformed DataFrame to a new CSV file
df.to_csv(output_file_path, index=False)

print(f"Transformed data saved to {output_file_path}")




Snowflake SQL code to use the COPY INTO command to load the transformed data into a Snowflake table.


-- Step 1: Create a stage (if not already created) to point to the location of the CSV file
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE my_stage
  FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY='"' SKIP_HEADER = 1)
  URL = 's3://your-bucket/path/to/transformed_file.csv'  -- Adjust to your storage location

-- Step 2: Copy data from the stage into the Snowflake table
COPY INTO your_target_table  -- Replace with your target Snowflake table name
FROM @my_stage
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV')
ON_ERROR = 'CONTINUE';  -- Adjust error handling as needed



Execution Steps:
Run the Python script to process the CSV file:
bash
Copy code
python extract_transform.py
Execute the Snowflake SQL commands in your Snowflake environment to load the transformed data.
This approach allows for a clean separation between data transformation and loading, making it easier to manage and maintain each step in your data pipeline.
